## How to contribute to GAMA

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or a **test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [gama-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gama-dev) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about your models?**

* Ask any question about how to use GAMA in the [gama-platform mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gama-platform).

* Consult the documentation on the [website] (http://gama-platform.org) or, alternatively, on the [wiki] (https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki).
